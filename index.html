                            Something would be amiss if I had excluded this Portfolio. I programmed it using HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as created the image to pair with it. I feel it speaks mainly for itself, therefore I shall keep it brief. I enjoyed this project for what I could learn from it and all the tricky challenges it presented and even if it took me initially roughly a week to complete it to a working order. I'll look forward to revisiting my Portfolio soon.<br>

I programmed all of it's content contained within using HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as created the image to pair with it. I had to resist animating any of its content, though I do plan to revisit this project in the future.
